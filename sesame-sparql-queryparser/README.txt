###################### SPARQL grammar for Recommendation ######################

# build from Sesame sparql 2.6.3 #

The Sesame SPARQL grammar has been changed for the SPARQL editor Recommendation
use case.

* Added on the 17 May 2012
- The "IRIref" state has an additional choice: the POF, i.e., the word "<" in
  the query.
- The "Object" state has an additional choice: the FillVar, i.e., a variable
  named ?FILL_VAR which is added when the object is missing. This allows to
  write "?s < " instead of adding a mandatory object, e.g., "?s < ?o".
- The "PathElt" state has been changed to specify a LOOKAHEAD of 2 for PathMod,
  in order to remove a choice conflict with the character '{'.
* Added on the 29 May 2012
- Updated the POF() clause: Recommendation with prefix filtering, on the QName
  and on an Incomplete URI_REF. Added LOOKAHEAD of 2 for the PrefixedName()
  clause.
